# Test-implementing PDF table recognition and extraction of data

Based on https://nanonets.com/blog/table-extraction-deep-learning/

Also see https://nanonets.com/blog/ocr-with-tesseract/

## Uses:
- pdf2image for converting PDF pages to images (once I implement it; should be trivial)
- OpenCV for finding blocks on the page (and possibly more, I don't know yet)
- Numpy because numbers, and probably pandas along the way.
- Tesseract for OCR (once I implement it)
